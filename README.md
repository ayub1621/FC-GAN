## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown great potential in generating realistic images. However, traditional GANs often suffer from slow convergence, which can hinder their practicality. FC-GAN addresses this issue by employing a fast-converging strategy that accelerates the differentiation of all classes, resulting in faster convergence speeds.

This program demonstrates the application of FC-GAN for image synthesis using the popular MNIST dataset. The implementation is done in Python, leveraging deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. Jupyter Lab provides an interactive environment for running and exploring the program.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Lab
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayub1621/FC-GAN.git
cd FC-GAN
```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. In Jupyter Lab, open the `fc_gan.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to prepare the MNIST dataset, build and train the FC-GAN model, and generate synthetic images.

4. Customize the hyperparameters, network architecture, and training strategy based on your requirements. You can experiment with different learning rates, model architectures, and optimization techniques to achieve better results.

5. Run the code cells in the notebook to execute the program, visualize the training progress, and generate synthetic images.

## Results
The program aims to generate high-quality synthetic images using the FC-GAN model trained on the MNIST dataset. By leveraging the fast-converging strategy, FC-GAN can achieve faster convergence speeds compared to traditional GANs while maintaining competitive image quality.

You can evaluate the quality of the generated images visually and quantitatively using metrics such as Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score (IS). Additionally, you may consider applying post-processing techniques or exploring alternative datasets for image synthesis tasks.
